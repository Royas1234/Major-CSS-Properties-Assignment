                <b> <i>I love technology because Technology makes life Easier and more fun through the use of Internet and also the use of Amenities like Washing Manchine, Dish Washer etc..
                ways of communication and data transfer require a lot less paper, which I honestly believe means there's a tree out there (or even better, a whole forest) living happily ever after. But that's hardly all of it! I've even decided to go a step further and purchase only the books I really find amazing and would like to encourage all of you fellow book worms to do the same. I get all of my reads in eBook format, read them and then decide on whether I want them or not. It helps me get more books for the same amount of money, allows me to have a library that's free of all those books that are pretty much useless after the first read and there are less trees being cut down to be processed into paper.</b></i></p>

                <b><i>Differences between paddings, borders and margins are Padding - The inner space between the content and the border of your box.Padding is a CSS property that defines the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border). If an element has a border around it, padding will give space from that border to the element content which appears in that border. If an element does not have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that element, because there is no border to give space from
                 Border - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line,A border  goes around the padding and content

If an element does not have a border, then margin defines the space from the element content to the next outer element.<b><i></p>
